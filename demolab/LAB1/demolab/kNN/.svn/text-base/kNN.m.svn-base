function cOut = kNN( x, Y, c, k)
%KNN Your own kNN classifier!
%   cOut = kNN(x, Y, c, k)
%   
%   cOut will be your output from kNN() and should thus be one of the
%   classesd defined in c.
%
%   x is the feature vector we want to classify
%
%   Y is a matrix containing the training feature vectors used to classify 
%   new vexctors
%
%   c is a vector containing the class of every vector in Y
%
%   k is the number of neighbours that will participate in the voting
%   procedure.
%
%   There are many ways to implement kNN, but the functions max, hist, sort
%   and sum might be worth looking at. (ie type 'help sum' or 'doc sum'
